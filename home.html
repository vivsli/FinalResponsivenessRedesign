  <h1>Redesigning Harvard</h1>
  <h2 class="words"> As a part of my UI/UX class, I redesigned the course website for
    one of Harvard University's computer science courses (http://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/courses/Fall2020/). Here are the
    steps
    I took to accomplish this:
  </h2>
  <div class="boxed">
    <ol>
      <li>I indentified usability problems</li>
      <li>I created a low-fidelity wireframe based on the usability problems identified</li>
      <li>I designed a high-fidelity prototype inspired by the course website of my own CS course at Brown.</li>
      <li>I made a visual design guide to explain my design decisions</li>
      <li>I actualized my high-fidelity prototype into an HTML/CSS website</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Finding Usability Problems</h1>

    <div class="boxed">
      <h2>What I see as usability issues:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Difficult to make out a text hierarchy because the differences between text sizes are too small</li>
        <li>Not really sure what the different colors stand for, specifically the dark and light blue</li>
        <li>A lot of information that isn't sectioned enough, makes it difficult to find specific information</li>
        <li>Could use some pictures to make it more visually appealing</li>
        <li>Not super clear what is interactive (clickable) and what isn't</li>
        <li>In the mobile and tablet versions, there are no margins or padding so the text just extends all the way to
          the edges of the screen and are difficult to read</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>What WebAIM WAVE sees as usability issues:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No language assigned</li>
        <li>28 contrast errors</li>
        <li>The structure is composed of 1 header and 8 unordered lists</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="boxed">
      <h2>What the screen reader sees that can be interpreted as usability issues:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are so many links that it reads out which is really uneccessary and breaks the flow of information
        </li>
      </ul>
